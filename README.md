# 📝 Description

This is a homework assignment we completed in Digital Product Management class, working on making surveys for people to fill out. This type of practice was crucial for learning to complete our porfolio website later on in the semester. It was tough for me personally throughout the semester, but I was able to work hard and learn for the final project of the semester.

Thank you to Mr. Colbert for being great teacher over these last few years, I have been able to learn so much from your classes. Students in the Tippie College of Business at Iowa should look for classes that he is teaching, and take them!
